- My Journey to A&M
---
This is my **first post**.

My name is Taylor Hartman. I am a senior at Texas A&M University. I am a Communication major and pursing a minor in English. Texas A&M has been my dream school since I was young. I am writing this blog to help inspire others. I remember thinking I was not smart or good enough for A&M and gave up on my dream. At least that is what I thought. Starting my college career off at two community colleges is what led me here. Although I would have never thought that was the case if you were to ask me four or three years ago. Moral of the story is if I would have settled and not tried to push myself then or course I would have never got into A&M. Yet, since I would not let my self settle for the easy option, I was able to chase my dreams.
